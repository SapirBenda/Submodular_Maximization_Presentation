# Submodular_Maximization_Presentation

As a part of my B.Sc. I'm glad to share a presentation I presented at the faculty, that talks about approximizations algorithms of submodular maximization problrms.
In general, finding the exact solution to a submodular maximization problem is NP-hard, which means that there is no known algorithm that can solve the problem in polynomial time. However, there exist efficient algorithms that can provide approximate solutions to the problem within some factor of the optimal solution.

We presented several approximation algorithms for the problem, and mainly focused on MPC ( Massively Parallel Computation) algorithms.
✔Greedy Sequential Algorithm
✔RandGreeDI MPC Algorithm
✔Threshold Greedy Sequential Algorithm
✔Sample-and-Prune Technique
✔Threshold MPC Algorithm
