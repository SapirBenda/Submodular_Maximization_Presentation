# Submodular_Maximization_Presentation

A presentation I presented with Leah London Arazi as part of the seminar in the theory of distributed algorithms at TAU.
We presented the submodular maximization problem and various algorithms that try to solve it. The goal is to find a subset of a predetermined size such that this set maximizes the submodular function.
Submodular maximization is NP-hard, so we presented efficient sequential and massively parallel computation (MPC) approximation algorithms:
✔Greedy Sequential Algorithm ✔RandGreeDI MPC Algorithm ✔Threshold Greedy Sequential Algorithm ✔Sample-and-Prune Technique ✔Threshold MPC Algorithm

We based on chapter 6 of Mohsen Ghaffari’s article on massively parallel algorithms: http://people.csail.mit.edu/ghaffari/MPA19/Notes/MPA.pdf
